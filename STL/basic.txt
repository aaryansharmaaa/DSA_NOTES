What is stl??

Answer--->

STL stands for standard templet library , these are special kind of in built library whose mening is already define to compiler , they are made to perfom 
special task in the code 

for example we define an array of size 5 but we want to push the 6th element inside it the only possible way is to by changing the size of array
but there is somthiong in stl called vector suppose we define an vector of size 4 and vector is full but we want to push the 5th element in it 
so vector automaticaly increase it size to twice and we can add n numbers of element inside the vector so this is the use of standard templet library.

What is iterator 

Iterator is basically the pointer that is pointing toward the perticular element inside the container...

vector<int> :: iterator=itr;
