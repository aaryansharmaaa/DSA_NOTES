How the program was run what are the step followed to run the program ??

Answer...

First we got the problem statement , then we have to take the pen paper and write down the login in paen paper and create the pseudo code of it
then we have to create a flow chart ie.. what are the condition what are variables we have to define then after the 
need of compiler come write the code in the compiler then compiler conver the code from plan formate to machine understandabel code in the binary formate
and the exc file was generated then it will indicate that the program was terminated suscessfully...


What is runtime, compileitme...

Compiletime is basically the thing or all the work that re done on the backend for example compliler are converting all the thing in the
machine understandabel language , or is there is any error inside the program it is going to show at the tiem of compile tiem

Runtime is basically the thing that are the work that happen after the compile time after that all the errorin the program are clear
all the input are taken and all the output are shown during runtime...
